    <h1>Sprint 4: </h1>
    <p> 
        My aim for this version is to add in undo and reset buttons for the drawing area.<br>
        In this version, my user should be able to undo their last action that they have done on the drawing area( or reset the whole page)<br>
        Now, my user doesn't need to refresh the whole website every time when they don't like what they have done.

    <h1>Sprint 2: </h1>
    <p> 
        My aim for this version is to be able to use buttons to create different shapes (rectangle and ellipse) on canvas.<br>
        This program should allow the user to change in between rectangle and ellipse within boundary.

    <h2>Testing videos: </h2>
    <p>This is my first testing video for this version, this is trying to draw an ellipse out</p>

    <p>
        This my second testing video <br>
        In this video, user is able to click into different buttons and drag out different shapes (rectangle and ellipse) within the boundary box <br>
        Also, the shapes would have beem coloured in and they should just stay in the reactanle unless the user refrashes the whole website.

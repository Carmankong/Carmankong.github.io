    <h1>Sprint 8: </h1>
    <p> 
        The aim for this version is to able to create different sizing buttons (brush) for my user to use. <br>
        This program should have 5 different sizing buttons and the user should be able to switch between them really easily.
    </p>

    <h2>My trello page:</h2>
    <div><img width="600" class="imgSizer" src="v8_trello.jpg"></div>
    <p>in shape.js, the variable of this.r = 10 should change into this.r = r as now it is connected with the buttons.</p>
    <h2>Testing videos: </h2>
    <p> In this testing video as you can see, it shows how all of the sizing buttons are working smoothly.</p>
    <video width="600" controls>
